# Chef-and-Division-3-
Chef wants to host some Division-3 contests. Chef has N setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The ith setter has made Ai problems where 1≤i≤N.  A Division-3 contest should have exactly K problems. Chef wants to plan for the next D days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.  Given these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these D days?  Input: The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - N, K and D respectively. The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN respectively. Output: For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these D days.
